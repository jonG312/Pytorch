# Pytorch
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pytorch is an open source deep learning library developed by the Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR). It is a library widely used in artificial intelligence since it allows to develop computer vision by creating a neural network, natural language processing for the development of language translators, language modeling and chatbox development by implementing the RNN and LSTM architectures, it also allows reinforcement learning for the development of robotic automation and robot movement control by implementing the Deep Q learning architecture. Pytorch implements a simple interface and great performance due to its ability to use the graphics processing unit (GPU). Pytorch can load the data, apply the transformations, and build models with a few lines of code.<P/>
